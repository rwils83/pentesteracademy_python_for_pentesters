# Video: Process Creation

## Forking
### What is it?  
* Cloning of a process
* Forking creates an identical process as the parent
* The thread of execution is duplicated exactly at the point of call to fork()
  * returns 0 in the child
  * returns pid of child in the parent
* PID is different for parent/child
* Dedicate child to a task given by the parent
* parent and child can communicate if required using IPC
* parent/child binary remains the same
## Spawning new process
* os.exec* functions
  * os.execl
  * os.execle
  * os.execvp
* Child overlays the parent
*
